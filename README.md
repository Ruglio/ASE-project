This paper introduces an innovative approach to aviation network design, taking into consideration a diverse fleet of aircraft with varying capacities and maximum travel distances. The model presented in this research aims to adapt to the emergence of electric aviation technologies, challenging the conventional Hub-and-Spokes (H\&S) network design paradigm. The findings illustrate how the model handles scenarios involving either increased landing costs or heightened demand. Additionally, this report explores practical implications associated with implementation, including the necessity for adaptable infrastructure and the impact of evolving passenger preferences within the dynamic electric transportation industry. Future research could explore the integration of elements from the H\&S model into the proposed approach and incorporate additional factors, such as infrastructural costs, to provide a more comprehensive and realistic perspective.
